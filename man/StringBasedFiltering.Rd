reverse or both).}
\usage{
StringBasedFiltering(
  obj,

  idRev2Delete = NULL,
  prefix_Rev = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{An object of class \code{MSnSet}.}

\item{idCont2Delete}{The name of the column that correspond to the
contaminants to filter}

\item{prefix_Cont}{A character string that is the prefix for the
contaminants to find in the data}

\item{idRev2Delete}{The name of the column that correspond to the
reverse data to filter}

\item{prefix_Rev}{A character string that is the prefix for the reverse to
find in the data}
}
\value{
An list of 4 items :
\itemize{
\item obj : an object of class \code{MSnSet} in which the lines have been deleted
\item deleted.both : an object of class \code{MSnSet} which contains the deleted
lines corresponding to both contaminants and reverse,
\item deleted.contaminants : n object of class \code{MSnSet} which contains the
deleted lines corresponding to contaminants,
\item deleted.reverse : an object of class \code{MSnSet} which contains the
deleted lines corresponding to reverse,
}
