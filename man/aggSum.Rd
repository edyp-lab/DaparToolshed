\title{Compute the intensity of proteins with the sum of the intensities
of their peptides.}
\usage{
aggSum(qPepData, X)
}
\arguments{
\item{qPepData}{A matrix of intensities of peptides.}

\item{X}{An adjacency matrix in which lines and columns correspond 
respectively to peptides and proteins.}
}
\value{
A matrix of intensities of proteins.
}
\description{
This function computes the intensity of proteins based on the sum of the 
intensities of their peptides.
