\title{Missing values imputation from a \code{MSnSet} object}
\usage{
impute.pa2(
  tab,
  conditions,
  q.min = 0,
  q.norm = 3,
  eps = 0,
  distribution = "unif"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tab}{An object of class \code{MSnSet}.}

\item{conditions}{A vector of conditions in the dataset}

\item{q.min}{A quantile value of the observed values allowing defining the
maximal value which can be generated. This maximal value is defined by the
quantile q.min of the observed values distribution minus eps.
Default is 0 (the maximal value is the minimum of observed values minus eps).}

\item{q.norm}{A quantile value of a normal distribution allowing defining
the minimal value which can be generated. Default is 3 (the minimal value
is the maximal value minus qn*median(sd(observed values)) where sd is the
standard deviation of a row in a condition).}

\item{eps}{A value allowing defining the maximal value which can be
generated. This maximal value is defined by the quantile q.min of the
observed values distribution minus eps. Default is 0.}

\item{distribution}{The type of distribution used. Values are unif or beta.}
}
\value{
The object \code{obj} which has been imputed
}
\description{
This method is a variation to the function \code{impute.pa()} from the
package \code{imp4p}.
