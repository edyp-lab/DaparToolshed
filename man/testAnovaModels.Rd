\title{Applies a statistical test on each element of a list of linear models}
\usage{
testAnovaModels(aov_fits, test = "Omnibus")
}
\arguments{
\item{aov_fits}{a list of linear models, such as those outputted by applyAnovasOnProteins}

\item{test}{a character string among "Omnibus", "TukeyHSD", "TukeySinglestep",
"TukeyStepwise", "TukeyNoMTC", "DunnettSinglestep", "DunnettStepwise" and "DunnettNoMTC".
"Omnibus" tests the all-mean equality, the Tukey tests compares all pairs of means and
the Dunnet tests compare all the means to the first one. For multiple tests (Dunnet's or Tukey's)
it is possible to correct for multiplicity (either with single-step or step-wise FWER) or not.
All the Tukey's and Dunnet's tests use the multcomp package expect for "TukeyHSD" which
relies on the stats package.  "TukeyHSD" and "TukeyStepwise" gives similar results.}
