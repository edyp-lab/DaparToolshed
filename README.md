> Evolving `DAPAR` package towards Shiny modules and data structures from the 
packages MultiAssayExperiment and SummarizedExperiment




`DaparToolshed` is a package which provides all the necessary functions to 
analyze quantitative data from label-free proteomics experiments bases on the 
MultiAssayExperiment data structure.
Contrarily to most other similar R packages, it is endowed with rich and 
user-friendly graphical interfaces, so that no programming skill is 
required (see `Prostar` package).




### What is DaparToolshed?

`DaparToolshed` is a [Bioconductor
